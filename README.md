# What growth mindset means to me

Hi, I'm Anthony Hill, I'm a Full stack developer in training,Here is my [github link](https://github.com/anthonymhill23). I recently learned what growth mindset is and how to apply it to my own life. Here is what it means to me and things I can take away from this newfound knowledge

## Chaning the way we look at things
A lot of the time, whether  in life or at work we tend to become stuck in a paticular mindset, repeating those same actions over and over again, in the exact same way over and over again. This comes from Albert Einstein 
> "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.‚Äù

Here is my link for the quote from [Albert Einstein](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-parable-of-quantum-insanity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CInsanity%20is%20doing%20the%20same,usually%20attributed%20to%20Albert%20Einstein)

The reason that this is relevant in a growth mindset is that its okay to ***take a step back and reexamine things***. It never hurts to take a break and walk away. It only helps. I personally am trying to be better at this one, which is why its number one on my list

## Effort and how it matters in all things
I personally love to lift weights and do pretty much anything in the realm of strongman sports. However those things require an IMMENSE amount of physical effort. I am great at applying that effore to my life. What I am not the best at, is applying those things to things that are not the most interesting to me. Growth mindset, in this aspect means to apply the same effort I would apply for lifting into everything else in life. It's a simple concept, but very difficult to master. Just like everything else in life, It requires effort to do so.

## Obstacles and how to overcome them.

In life, we all have obstacles, The amount of them varies in each of us from person to person. What growth mindset tells us to do, is to ***face them head on and not run from them***. Keeping a balance between taking a step back when necessary and facing a problem is a hard line to walk, but its just another obstacle to overcome. Its easy to do, hard to master, just like all things in life. I'm generally a problem fixer in life so facing obstacles in life is just a matter of perservence and time

So in order of importance, we have
- Challenges
- Effort
- Obstacles

Changing your mindset can be difficult, but the benefits are worth it. üòÑ
