# Expressions and operators

This chapter will describe Javasctipt's expressions which includes assingments, comparisons, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string,ternary and more

A complete and detailed list of operators and expression is available here. [Detailed list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)

Java script has both binary and unary operators and one special ternary operator(which is a conditional operator)
A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

operand1 operator operand2

An example of this is : (3+4) or x*y

An unary opewrator requires a songle operand, either before or after the operator

operand operator

An example of thie is : x++ or ++x

## Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the valus of its right operand. The asimple operator is equal (=) which assigns its valuse to the right operand to its left operand
Basically x=y assigns the value of y to x
