# what is HTML

    Html Is a standard markup language used to tax text files for font, color, graphic and hyperlink effects. It stands for "HyperText Markup Language".

## Main elements of HTML

    HTML consists of **4 main elements**. They are the opening tag, the closing tag, the content and the element. Each part of the elemnts serves a paticular purpose. The opening and closing tag can dictate a lot of things for the  content. Many beginning soft ware developers often forget to add the closing tag which can lead to some unfavorable outcomes. 
    Elements can also have attributes  that contain extra information that you dont actually want to show up in the content.
    An attribute should always have the following. 
    1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element has one or more attirbute)
    2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign [ class="editor name']
    3. The attribute valus wrapped by opening and closing quoation marks

## Nesting elements

You can put elements inside other elements , this is called nesting. This can be useful to strongly emphasiz a pooint or action. You do need to ensure that the elements are properly nested, otherwise the effect will not work properly. 

Proper <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

Improper<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>

Ensuring its nested properly is what makes the distinction. 

These are just a few things to take into context when learning HTML, these things are thigns I forget most of the time. So im passing my knowledge to you, Hopefully it helps :smile
