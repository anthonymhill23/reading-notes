 # Coding Notes.

## What is a text editor?
All a text editor is a program , or a piece of software that you install on your computer (some can be done through a web browser). There are 4 things you should consider at a minimum for a text editor. 
* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* themes (these are important to reduce eye strain and eye fatigus, which is important cause in the future, you'll spend a lot of time in front of your PC)
* Extensions


## Extensions
Different coding languages matter, some give synetx highlighting, which highlghts certain parts of your text based on if its an attribute or a element. The reason that's soo important is because coding can be a time-consuming project. **Having different parts different colors can be a time saver when debugging your code**. Another feature to consider is a shorthand language called "Emmet". Emmet is a shorthand language. Many text editors either have Emmet naturally or can be added as an extension.

## Pre-installed software and why others can be better 
All computers cone with a text editor. For Windows machines , you naturally have notepad., for mac, yyou have "text edit". Linix also has it, but that varies based on the linux version you have installed, or by its distributor. Notepad and text edit can be used to edit text, however, they dont have the best capability naturally, so thats why we want better programs. an example of a better program to get is Notepad ++ , It has syntax highlighting and code completion as well as word and function completion as well. My current favorite  is Visual studio code, made by microsoft, its only avaliable on Windows Machines. It has everything i need as well as having the capabality to add more extensions easily, if need be. It couldnt be more efficent to me, unless it wrote the code in your head by its self ðŸ˜„

All in all, coding can be a hard thing to get into, but with the right text editor , it can make the process of compleiting code so much easier, as well as the process of debugging code.
