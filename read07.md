# Programming with Javascript

Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Javascript. A function in javascript is similar to a procedure. A set of statments that perfprms a task or calculates a value.However for a procedure to qualify, it should take some imput and return an output to where there is some obvious relationship between the two. To use a a function, you must define it somwehre in the scope from which you wish to call it. 

## Defining Functions

A function definition (also known as a functiondeclaration, or function statement ) consists of the function keyword followed by

<ul>
<li> The name of the function </li>
<li> A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas   </li>
<li> The Javascript statements that define the function,enclosed in curly brackets {     } </li>
</ul>
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

> #### function square(number) {
>  return number * number;
> }
...

## Javascript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A Javascript function is defined with the function keyword followed by a name followed by parentheses ()
Function names can contain letters , digits, underscores and dollar signs (same rules as variables)
The parentheses ,ay include parameter names seperated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, etc etc)
Important thing to note, the code to be executed by the function is placed inside the curly brackets.

Function parameters are listed INSIDE the parentheses () in the function department.
