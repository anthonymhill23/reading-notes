# Programming wiht Javascript

Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Javascript. A function in javascript is similar to a procedure. A set of statments that perfprms a task or calculates a value.However for a procedure to qualify, it should take some imput and return an output to where there is some obvious relationship between the two. To use a a function, you must define it somwehre in the scope from which you wish to call it. 

## Defining Functions

A function definition (also known as a functiondeclaration, or function statement ) consists of the function keyword followed by

<ul>
<li> The name of the function </li>
<li> A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas   </li>
<li> The Javascript statements that define the function,enclosed in curly brackets {     } </li>
</ul>
