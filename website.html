    This is the first time I've ever done HTML in my life. "look mom, im becoming a software developer"
    I've learned a few things about HTML in class ,Here are a few of my notes
 In HTML you can use many things to design your page. one of the most commonly used ones is <pre> <p> in this section I could type my whole paragrapth and add all important content to this section </p> </pre>
Another important thing to remember is Lists. There are two version of lists, ordered and unordered. <pre> <li></li> and <ul></ul></pre> respectively
